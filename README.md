The Airbnb Hotel Booking Analysis project focuses on analyzing Airbnb’s open dataset for New York City to uncover insights into pricing trends, host behavior, and customer satisfaction. As Airbnb continues to transform the hospitality industry by connecting hosts and guests through an online marketplace, understanding the factors influencing listing performance and user experience becomes essential.

This project applies data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to extract meaningful patterns from raw, unstructured data. The dataset initially contains missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers, which are handled through systematic preprocessing steps such as standardizing column names, converting data types, removing duplicates, and correcting invalid entries.

The analysis seeks to answer key questions, including:

What are the most common property and room types?
Which neighborhoods have the highest number of listings and average prices?
Is there a relationship between construction year and pricing?
Do verified hosts receive better reviews?
How are price and service fees correlated?

Through these explorations, the project highlights the main drivers of Airbnb performance in New York City. Statistical insights and visualizations—created using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn—help reveal trends in host activity, room availability, and guest ratings.

The findings aim to assist multiple stakeholders: hosts can refine their pricing and property strategies, guests can identify value-for-money listings, and analysts or policymakers can better understand the dynamics of short-term rentals in urban markets.

Ultimately, this project provides a data-driven overview of Airbnb’s operations in one of the world’s busiest cities. By combining analytical techniques with clear visual storytelling, it transforms raw data into actionable insights, contributing to more informed decisions in the hospitality and tourism sectors.
